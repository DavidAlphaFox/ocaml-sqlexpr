This is the INSTALL file for the ocaml-sqlexpr distribution.

This package uses OASIS to generate its build system. See section OASIS for
full information.

If you obtained the sources from the source repository (as opposed to a
release tarball), you will have to generate the build system using oasis, with

     $ oasis setup

If you don't have OASIS, the easiest way to install it is via OPAM with

     $ opam install oasis
